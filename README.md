### Let's Learn By Collaborating ###

> What's up coders! I'm just getting started with my journey into Python and coding at large and wanted 
> to hop onto Github since it's such a prolific community (no brainer). At the heart of it, I believe that Github is a great learning opportunity.
> Please feel free submit issues or pull requests or whatever it is you wierdos do here on Github. I want to get inside your little coder mind. 

> I'm interested primarily in Python for business application, such as finacial & business modeling, so I anticipate most of the code in this repo 
> will concern that.
